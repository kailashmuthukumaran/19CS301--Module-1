Exp.No:1(a)	PYTHON BASICS-PRINTING MULTILINE STRING

### AIM
To create a python program to print the string in multiline using triple quotes.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Use triple quotes (''' or """) to define a string that spans multiple lines.

Step 3:	 Use the print() function to display the multi-line string.

Step 4:	 Terminate the program

### PROGRAM
```
print('''I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple single quotes
I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple double quotes
''')



```

### RESULT
Thus the python program for printing multiline strings has been implemented and executed successfully.

Exp.No:1(b)	DATA TYPES-PYTHON PROGRAM TO PRINTING INTEGER LITERALS

### AIM
To write a python program to print the following integer literals 123,456,789
### ALGORITHM
Step 1:	Begin the program.

Step 2:	Initialize the integer literals 123, 456, and 789.

Step 3:	Use the print() function to display the numbers 123, 456, and 789.

Step 4:	Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
num1 = 123
num2 = 456
num3 = 789
print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)
```
### OUTPUT

Thus the python program for printing the Integer Literals has been implemented and executed successfully.






Exp.No:1(c)	VARIABLES AND EXPRESSIONS, OPERATORS ADDING TWO COMPLEX NUMBERS

### AIM
To write a python program for adding two complex numbers, get the user input using the eval() function.
### ALGORITHM
Step 1:	Begin the program.

Step 2:	Use eval() to get two complex numbers as input from the user.

Step 3:	Print the complex numbers entered by the user.

Step 4:	Perform the addition of the two complex numbers using + operator.

Step 5:	Print the sum of the two complex numbers.

Step 6:	Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
A = eval(input())
B = eval(input())

sum_complex = A + B

print(sum_complex)
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program for  adding two complex numbers has been implemented and executed successfully.


Exp.No:1(d)	CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS- CHECKING ODD OR EVEN

### AIM
To Write a python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if..else statement
### ALGORITHM
Step 1: Begin the program.

Step 2: Take a character input from the user

Step 3: If a % 2 == 0 (i.e., a is divisible by 2) Print "EVEN"

Step 4: Otherwise, display "ODD"

Step 5: Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
a=int(input())
if(a%2==0):
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus, the Python program for checking whether a number is odd or even has been implemented and executed successfully.





Exp.No:1(e)	SEB- TWO PERSONS NAME IS SAME OR NOT 

### AIM
write a python program to check whether two persons  name is same or not .print the result in true or false
### ALGORITHM

Step 1: Begin the program.

Step 2: Read the first name and store it in variable a.

Step 3: Read the second name and store it in variable b.

Step 4: Compare the two names. If a is equal to b, then display "True".

Step 5: Otherwise, display "False".

Step 6: Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
```
a=input()
b=input()
if a==b:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
```
### OUTPUT
![Screenshot 2025-06-02 103825](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a69644b3-bd51-4c52-bbb3-2f16943f924d)


 
### RESULT
Thus, the Python program for checking whether two persons names are the same has been implemented and executed successfully.
